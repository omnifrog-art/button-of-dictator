# button-of-dictator

A web-based trigger system enacting irreversible domain-level erasure.  
Behaviour creates consequence.

The button sentences the domain to death —  
not merely erasing the interface,  
but flattening and shredding its content into silence.

---

## ➤ SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Each subdomain is a single-use trigger page.  
One click → execution → disappearance.

No confirmation. No reversal. No moral cue.

The domain itself is then executed — its DNS revoked, its presence annulled.  
What was once an address becomes a dead token —  
its record sealed in the log.

---

## ➤ INTERACTION PHILOSOPHY

This is interaction in its most irreversible form.

The button does not progress to the next page.  
It does not give feedback, animation, or affirmation.  
It ends something.

Historically, a button was never symbolic:  
- It was a lever.  
- A switch.  
- A trigger.  
- A death sentence.

Mechanically minimal, ethically maximal.  
What we now see as playful UI originated as command architecture —  
Designed not to seduce, but to execute.

---

## ➤ THEORETICAL BLUEPRINT

- Interfaces are not neutral.  
- UX systems often obscure causality behind "states".  
- What appears interactive may only conceal the one-way logic of control.

This work aligns with:

- **Foucault**: disciplinary power coded into systems.  
- **Wittgenstein**: the limit of language as the limit of action.  
- **Marxist critique of UX**: interaction as behavioural alienation.  

Also referencing:  
- ドラえもん「どくさいスイッチ」(Doraemon: Dictator Switch)  
  *with respect to Fujiko F. Fujio, whose vision transcended age.*

## ➤ STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCE

The disappearance is not symbolic.  
The domain is unlinked, unhosted, removed from visibility and access.  
The system logs its loss. But does not reverse it.

---

## ➤ SYSTEM MAP

- `*.buttonofdictator.xyz`: pseudo-wildcard subdomains, pre-generated and API-injected to Vercel  
- `/log.json`: records terminated domains  
- `/log.html`: public record of disappearance  
- `/00000.*`: reserved homage to Dokusai Switch  
- `/00sam.*`: dedicated to Sam, my CTS tutor and intellectual anchor through the most turbulent stage of my studies

---

## ➤ DEPLOYMENT NOTES

- Domain via Porkbun  
- Hosting via Vercel (wildcard enabled)  
- Static front-end, pseudo-destructive logic  
- Logging: currently static → to become dynamic endpoint

## ➤ PERSONAL FOOTNOTE

In 2022, while discussing interaction and ethical boundaries,  
I remarked: “a trigger is just a dictator's button.”

A teacher interrupted, concerned:  
> “Designing weapons is strictly prohibited.”

But I was not designing a weapon.  
I was naming what already exists —  
A button whose consequence precedes consent.  
A system that executes without negotiation.

## ➤ TODO

- Implement 50 valid subdomains (limit reached)  
- Build `/log.html` with finalised styling  
- Finalise 404-redirection as symbolic obit  
- Consider poster/flyer/QR-code physical deployment

## ➤ CLOSING COMMENT

This repository will not be maintained.  
Its structure is complete.  
It is designed to collapse.  
Like all authority.
