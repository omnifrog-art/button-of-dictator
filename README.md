# button-of-dictator

A web-based trigger system simulating the residue of authoritarian interfaces.  
Behaviour creates consequence. Consequence erases interface.

---

## ➤ SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Each subdomain contains a single-use interface.  
One click → execution → disappearance.

No confirmation. No reversal. No moral cue.

---

## ➤ PHILOSOPHICAL BLUEPRINT

- Interfaces are not neutral.
- The most innocent UI element—a button—can carry the most violent command.
- This is not design. This is residual power architecture.

## ➤ TERMINAL INTERACTION

This system is not non-interactive.

It is interactive in the most essential, most unbearable, most irreversible sense.

The button does not lead to a next step.  
It does not trigger feedback, animation, or affirmation.  
It triggers an **end**.

This is what a button was, long before design made it soft:

- A lever.  
- A switch.  
- A trigger.  
- A death sentence.

Mechanically simple, ethically absolute.

This is not the gamified button of a web interface.  
It is the button as it existed in factories, control rooms, missile bays.

It carries no meaning.  
Only consequence.

## ➤ PERSONAL FOOTNOTE

An echo from 2022:  
I was merely discussing the ethical limit of interaction design—  
the moment when a button stops being symbolic and becomes operative.

A teacher, visibly uneasy, interrupted:  
**"It is strictly prohibited to design weapons here."**

But I wasn't designing a weapon.  
I was exposing how a button already carries the structure of violence.

The moment wasn't about threat.  
It was about revealing that design cannot remain innocent.

## ➤ SYSTEM STRUCTURE

- `*.buttonofdictator.xyz`: wildcard subdomains, each a single-use instance
- `/log.json`: tracks (manually or eventually via backend) clicked entries
- `/log.html`: displays visible interface residues
- `/00000.*`: reserved tribute logic (dokusai switch)

---

## ➤ DEPLOYMENT NOTES

- Domain from Porkbun  
- Hosted via Vercel (wildcard enabled)  
- Static page buttons; interaction is simulated destruction  
- Logging is static for now; future: dynamic logging via POST handler

---

## ➤ INTERNAL COMMENTS

- build this like a cold system  
- avoid poetic over-writing  
- avoid narrative seduction  
- keep the silence loud

---

## ➤ TODO

- first 5 child interfaces
- log.html with redacted styling
- deploy link spreading system (QR? cryptic forums? printed flyers?)

---

## ➤ FINAL LINE

This repository won't be maintained.  
It is designed to fail gracefully, like all authority.
